          CSS is often more powerful than people give it credit for. A number of
          common tasks which generally rely on JavaScript libraries can often be
          implemented in CSS without much effort. A great example of this is the
          parallax effect which is currently in vogue. (Where background images
          scroll more slowly than the page content to give an illusion of
          distance.)
